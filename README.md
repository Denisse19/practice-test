## Grading 
Each challenge is Pass/Fail, there is no middle ground. Be meticulous with your code. 

If you receive a score that you are satisfied with, you may opt to not take the final and use the score received for the practice test in place of your final test score. 

If you take the final, you may use the 30% of your practice test score as extra credit that will be applied to your final test score.
